It would be nice to see some more options in terms of graphs (for example, if we wanted to show progress toward an enrollment target during a registration period we would see a progress bar that would continue to fill each day).  I am also often asked about tracking Persons from a particular course or set of courses to another course or set of courses.  Some of this can be done in Person Lookup, but I often find myself downloading datasheets so analyze data outside the warehouse for this type of request.  Additionally, we will need some more advanced security features to share or hide specific dimensions with certain groups of users and/or limit users' drill-down capabilities.  We would also like to see usage statistics.

I have found that most of this would pJohnably be hard to do from 's perspective.  A lot of the ""out of the box"" reports, thematic grouping of reports, or even training needs to be tailored specifically to the institution.  I have found that the best way to increase usage was to provide users with reports or features that they have  particular interest in viewing or that answer a particular question they often ask.  Because it is often specific, it might just require an employee of the institution to fill that role and meet with users.
