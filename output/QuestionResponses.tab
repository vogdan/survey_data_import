32	1584478503	Math Tutor Coordinator - Cedar Valley College
22	1584478503	I used Estudias daily between 2005 and November 2010. During that period, I used Estudias to monitor, improve services, and provide reports on services to El Centro College TRIO students. The report generated from Estudias were sent to the Department of Education and El Centro College staff and administration.
38	1584478503	I am hoping that the DCCCD will purchase the district license for me to start using Estudias here at Cedar valley College. When this is done, I expect  to continue to provide timely technical support for the software and enhanced customer service. Thank you.

46	2809933229	We would like to use the completion points feature more, but need some development on that.  It would be nice to see some more options in terms of graphs (for example, if we wanted to show progress toward an enrollment target during a registration period we would see a progress bar that would continue to fill each day).  I am also often asked about tracking Persons from a particular course or set of courses to another course or set of courses.  Some of this can be done in Person Lookup, but I often find myself downloading datasheets so analyze data outside the warehouse for this type of request.  Additionally, we will need some more advanced security features to share or hide specific dimensions with certain groups of users and/or limit users' drill-down capabilities.  We would also like to see usage statistics.  We are also interested in a more complex method of tracking transfer Persons (the institutions they transfer to, etc.).

41	2809933229	"This is just a comment about the others above.  I have found that most of this would pJohnably be hard to do from 's perspective.  A lot of the ""out of the box"" reports, thematic grouping of reports, or even training needs to be tailored specifically to the institution.  I have found that the best way to increase usage was to provide users with reports or features that they have  particular interest in viewing or that answer a particular question they often ask.  Because it is often specific, it might just require an employee of the institution to fill that role and meet with users.  If your resources allowed, perhaps having somone from  stay on site to consult with users for a week or two each time you do a launch and then maybe once a year after that?"

31	2809933229	We work with John Doe and he is fantastic. John has always been extremely helpful and provided a high level of cutomer service.  The only drawback is that more recently it has been harder to find time to meet or get in contact because he is very busy.  I know we are a pretty demanding institution, but sometimes we would like faster turn-around on support issues.  That being said, John has consistently met deadlines and promptly responded to urgent requests.

30	2809933229	Agree
12	2809933229	Most of our requests have been made within our desired time-frame.  However, in more recent months, this has been less true.  We have noticed less availability of our main contact at  and it has taken a toll in terms of getting our projects completed.

The main thing we would like to see improved is just the availability of our System person.  We have several projects that have been lined up for some time or have been delayed that we would really like to work through.  This has been difficult as  has expanded with new clients.

Thanks,  Paul      From: Mary Martinson   Sent: Tuesday, August 20, 2013 10:51 AM  To: Paul Brown  Subject: FW: Fall Xtreme Schedule    Hi Paul:  Can these course sections be loaded into  and the grades for that specific course auto populate at the end of the year when grades are posted?  Now that there are so many sections we cannot keep looking them up manually.

Allowing these users to ""open"" these groups within an Enterprise Report would be useful."

41	2803663137	"Additional Training videos would be very helpful - although doing so in a way that doesn't require logging in to the  support website would be even more helpful.  Additional documentation would also be helpful, although I generally think that videos are even better... having said that, we're now creating some step-by-step guides for creating certain complex reports/graphs that could be useful.  ""Standard"" reports are always welcome as we saw with our research team.  Not sure about organizing the software into smaller thematic components, though.  It could have the effect of making people more confused as to which area they should look for information they need (too many options).  However, BY FAR, the largest and most significant change would be to move off of OWC as fast as possible given that it's not cross-platform or cross-browser compatible and is starting to experience issues with Excel in Office 2013."

43	2786681176	Likely
61	2786681176	Implementation is extremely pJohnlematic for companys that do not have integrated IR and IT departments. IR staff don't usually have the IT knowledge required to implement the product and IT staff don't have the IR knowledge needed to do so. (By the way, this is true of many of your own IT folks -- they have no understanding of IR work. If they did, they wouldn't do some of the things they do.) Thus, I would caution companys on any recommendation about the length of time effective implementation and customization takes and the resources necessary to do it well.
83	2786681176	Please STOP changing the product without notification. Yes, I know we can go to the support page to see what was done, but this is written in technical laMnoage that is not user friendly to know what it means. A simple email would help. And STOP with the changes your technical people think are necessary. They aren't the ones USING the product!!! The new templates page, for example, is HORRIBLE!! The Lookup templates used to be nicely separated from the cube templates. Now they are all mixed together and selecting the correct one requires looking VERY closely at either the icon or the name. Technical folks are NOT the ones to be making design changes to the UI. They just don't think the same way or approach the product the way actual users do.

41	2778913254	I ran a  Users Group for our company. I had a difficulty making time for it. Leading the Users Group was a challenge because 1) another department was in charge of assigning licenses, 2) it is not easy to understand the output data developed by  (am I looking at what I think I am looking at?), and 3) some licensed users provide Persons services and others just analyze data (different training is needed for different folks). I finally decided to give up because many people coming to training were not using it. As I was not in charge of assigning licenses, I decided to stop investing my time on trying to get users to use the software.

80	2776508445	Within the last week
28	2776508445	We needed clarity on how different dimensions and measures worked, advising on how to create a correct filter in Person Lookup (there's no documentation at all by  on how to think about using filters, which means we've had to learn it the hard way via trial & error), and we needed to confirm that the logic of dimensions was working as appropriate to our institution.
34	2776508445	Somewhat Dissatisfied
31	2776508445	Being one of 's larger clients as well as having a team with competent project management and leadership on our side (we are ready to deploy quickly), we find ourselves often slowed down by the mis-matched level of support that  has provided.  With only one systems person (who has truly been helpful and wonderful in our time of need), time and time again we have had to delay or adjust a deadline due to limited bandwidth, support, and what feels like a lack of commitment to our goals and needs.

16	2776508445	The conversations around deliverables is unstructured as well as not to the point - we often hear a defense response on why things aren't done, rather than a constructive and proactive explanation for why something may not get completed and what the solution is.  Even better would be if we knew ahead of time of the meeting whether something needs to be adjusted, but often we learn of bad news, missed deliverables, or delays too late, which puts us in a bad position to our own bosses and people we are supporting with the platform.  Additionally, we often do not have visibility into the progress of software development items requested as well as engagement/feedback (until near the end of a development cycle) on any new development items that we've asked for.  As a project manager, I am often surprised at the lack of preparedness for an agenda - I can think of 2-3 different times when there was an unstructured agenda and plan, and the expectation was that we would use the meeting time to come up with an agenda or to do some work sharing what we thought we wanted.  I think  has great potential given the large client base and experience, but when I think back to our work together throughout the last 10 months, I have mixed feelings (some satisfaction and some disappointment).
30	2776508445	Disagree
12	2776508445	We are making progress and I have no doubt we will launch a platform that does fairly well.  But along the way we often had to make sacrifices to our deployment due to limited personing bandwidth and frankly, poor foresight, anticipation, and understanding from ’s end about the needs of our institution.

85	2776508445	 does a decent job at explaining the mechanics and navigation of the software (it could be better) but I find the trainings lacking in helping users figure out how they will use the system to answer real, relevant and complex questions.  When we planned for our researcher training (some who was there for the initial training), we spend nearly the first half day reviewing topics we had covered in the initial training.  The training design should be better differentiated and adjusted for different roles and levels.

46	2773727676	Some of the data is unreliable and the issues have not been fixed.  Demographic data using the old fields not the new, doesn't pull complete data for Persons who have attended longer than five years.  If you use the table filters you have to remember to put in the term on another filter.  This can give you bad data if you forget or you're new.  Also, listing each pJohnationary status or course separately is cumbersome.

Perhaps add another question to get at (In order to increase the number of individuals who could regularly use the software at your institution, what could  do better?       But to answer how I think you may have wanted to ask:  To increase the useability for the number of individuals who regularly use...? Offer more training--1. MOST helpful; Provide more document(user guides) 1. Most helpful; Deliver a set of std rsch rpts--4 Least helpful ---I have NO opinion here, seems subjective...some institutions like to fashion their own designs===some NEED a hand; Organize software into smaller, themati....---4 least helpful---think again some like to make their own up.

28	2773586784	Once a few months ago I think.  That was when I was given the access to the training page---that no one actually here said anything about.  I've been using it to study on my own for using the warehouse.  Thank you, it has really helped.  I'm in a very quiet department and busy people all around.  I like to be able to learn it on my own much as possible and only take a question or two to the rest of the dept here.

The word is getting out, they are looking for another component can't remember I think it was something to replace Oracle though and I didn't think that was your experience at all.
83	2773586784	I think what you are doing well is moving along with the customers maturity in what they see as what they need and can handle.  If there was too much thrown at them all at once it would be overwhelming.  I suspect there is more you can do than we access and that is great.  There will be others who will challenge you more.    I don't feel a need to share my story but you can contact me if you wanted to, I gave you my cell phone number below.

I believe I had already been taught what was shared to the larger group, and since I was also responsible for some of the logistics, I was not present 100% of the time - pJohnably 90% though, so other attendees may have marked ""strongly agree"".  I was glad John was there.  He picked up on a lot of the questions BHCers were asking and knew immediately how to respond, or what he needed to take back to work on.  (He had the knowledge of our systems so he could relate and respond/answer our questions confidently.  I believe that gave the trainees confidence and appreciation for  ""getting us"".)"

85	2773523396	In addition to individual phone calls when I encounter something I don't know how to do, the primary training I have used during this year is the online demos and training videos.  It's great to use them at the point when they are needed since I may have forgotten much of the general training by the time I need to use a particular feature or function.  More of those would be great.  Some of the webinars have also been helpful.
